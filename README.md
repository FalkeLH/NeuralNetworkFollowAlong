# Neural Network Follow-Along
I followed [Sentdex' tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3) on how to create a neural network in Python but I implemented it in Rust instead.

This project is mostly on Github because I wanted to learn more about it. It isn't actually useful for anything and I'll probably make it private soon.
